# Numerical Methods in Elixir

*Metnum* leverages [Nx](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx) to implement a wide range of numerical methods. This library is in early development stages, but aims to provide a vast range of iterative methods seen in numerical analysis, such as:

* Systems of Equations methods
* Ordinary Differential Equations methods
* Root Finding
* Extrema Finding
* Differentiation

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `metnum` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:metnum, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/metnum>.
